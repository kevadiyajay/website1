            1. Grease a steamer pan with 2 to 3 teaspoons oil.

2. Take 1.5 cups gram flour (120 grams besan) in a mixing bowl or pan. Do use gram flour which has a fine texture.

TIP: You can make khaman with chickpea flour as well.

3. The add the following ingredients:

2 to 3 pinches of turmeric powder
a generous pinch of asafoetida (skip to make a gluten-free version)
1.5 tablespoons lemon or lime juice or ⅓ to ½ teaspoon pure citric acid

1.5 teaspoons ginger paste (crush 1.5 inch ginger and 1.5 teaspoons green chilies in a mortar-pestle)
1.5 teaspoons green chili paste
1 tablespoon sugar or add according to taste
1 teaspoon salt or add as per taste
TIP: Avoid adding too much of turmeric powder as then the fruit salt or baking soda reacts with the turmeric powder and makes it red in color, thereby giving reddish dots, specks or tones in the khaman.

4. Add 1 cup water (or more or less as needed) and 1 tablespoon oil to make a thick yet smooth flowing batter. The amount of water needed depends on the quality of flour, so start with 1 cup and add as required. Stir well to combine.

5. Then add 1 tablespoon rava (semolina). This is entirely optional but adds a good texture to the khaman. Skip rava or semolina for a gluten-free option.

6. Stir with a whisk to create a smooth, thick batter without any lumps.

Consistency of Batter</br></br>
7. The batter should be thick yet flow easily off of the whisk. A quick tip is that if the batter becomes thin, then 1 to 2 tablespoons of gram flour.

Next bring 2 to 2.5 cups of water to a boil in a steamer pan or electric cooker or pressure cooker. The amount of water to be added depends on the size of the steamer or pressure cooker.

NOTE: To know more about the steaming in a pan, cooker and Instant Pot in detail, do read the tips section below.

9. Next add 2 teaspoons Eno or fruit salt. 2 teaspoons of Eno makes the khaman soft and fluffy. But there is a slightly alkaline taste to Eno.


If you’re not a fan of this flavor then add only 1.5 teaspoons of Eno. If using baking soda as your leavening agent add ½ teaspoon to ¾ teaspoon.

10. Stir the eno with the batter briskly and quickly.

11. The fruit salt should be mixed evenly with the batter. Or else you get uneven texture in the khaman.

12. The eno will make the batter become frothy, so you need to work quickly to whisk it in thoroughly.

12. Pour the prepared batter into the greased pan.

13. Gently shake so that the batter evens out in the pan. Below is a picture of the batter ready to be steamed.
