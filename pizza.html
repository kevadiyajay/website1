            Mixing: Boil one third of the water, then add it to the cold water in a bowl. This creates the correct temperature for activating yeast. Mix the salt and yeast into the water.</br></br>

Place the flour in a large bowl and pour the yeast mixture into it. Stir with a spoon until a dough starts to form. Continue mixing by hand until the pizza dough comes together and forms a ball. Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead with both hands for about 10 minutes, until it is firm and stretchy. Return the dough to the bowl. Cover and leave to rise in a warm place for about 2 hours or until doubled in size.</br></br>

Proofing: When the dough has roughly doubled in size, divide it into 3 or 4 equal pieces, depending on what size you want your pizzas to be (12 inches or 16 inches). Place each ball of dough in a separate bowl, cover and leave to rise for another 30 - 60 minutes, or until doubled in size.</br></br>

Note: It’s also possible to 'cold-prove' your pizza dough, a technique that allows the the dough to develop a deeper flavor. To do this, use half the amount of yeast listed in the ingredients, and leave the dough to rise in the fridge for 24-72 hours. When you are ready to use the dough, keep it outside the fridge for at least 3-5 hours, until it is up to room temperature.</br></br>

Stretching: Start with a rounded ball of pizza dough as this makes it easier to shape the base into a circle. Place the ball on a lightly floured surface, flour your hands and use your fingertips to press the dough into a small, flat disc. Working from the center, push the dough outwards while spreading your fingers, making the disc slightly bigger. Keep doing this till you have a roughly 12 or 16 inch pizza base. Neapolitan-style pizza bases are very thin, so you should be able to see through the base when you hold it up to the light. Take care when doing this – you don’t want it to tear.</br></br>

Once the pizza dough is stretched, lightly dust flour on your pizza peel and pull the base onto it. If you see any small holes in the dough, gently pinch them back together. Once you’re happy with the base, add your toppings and bake in your pizza oven for pizza in 60 seconds! We recommend starting with our Margherita Pizza recipe! </br></br>
