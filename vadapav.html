            1. Boil 2 large potatoes that weigh about 350 grams. Peel and then mash them with a fork in a bowl.

You can boil or steam the potatoes in a pan, Instant pot or stovetop pressure cooker adding water as needed.


Remember to drain the water very well from the boiled potatoes before you mash them. Set aside the potatoes to cool. When they become warm, peel and mash them with a fork or a potato masher.

Also crush 6 to 7 small/medium-sized garlic cloves and 1 to 2 green chilies in a mortar pestle.

Assemble Vada Pav

If you don’t have sweet chutney, then make the vada pav with green chutney. The green chutney and sweet chutney recipes are mentioned in the recipe card below.

You can make these two chutney recipes some hours ahead or a day before and refrigerate.</br></br>
