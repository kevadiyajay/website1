            Step 1 Saut√© cumin seeds for potato filling
            To make delicious samosas at home, first, make the filling. Put a pan on medium flame and add 2 tsp olive oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.

            Step 3 Prepare the dough for the Samosa
            Now, to prepare the dough, take a mixing bowl and combine all-purpose flour along with carom seeds and salt. Mix and then add ghee and start kneading by adding a little water at a time. Ensure that you add water gradually and make a firm dough. A soft dough will not make your samosas crispy. Cover the dough with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for about half an hour.

            Step 4 Roll the dough in small puris and cut into half
            once done, roll out few small-sized balls from the dough. Flatten them further with the help of your palms and then with a rolling pin. Give them a round shape and cut in half. Now dip your hands in water, fold the edges of the semi-circle in order to give it a cone shape.

            Step 5 Fill the semi-circle with potato filling and deep fry
            Take the filling with the help of a spoon and stuff it in the cone. Seal the ends properly by pressing the edges lightly with your fingers. Then, heat olive oil in a pan and deep fry the samosas on low heat until they turn golden brown and crispy. Serve with tomato ketchup and green chutney. Enjoy it as a tea-time snack!
