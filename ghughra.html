            Knead the dough for about 1 min.</br></br>
            take a small portion of dough and make smooth round balls.</br></br>
            Using one dough ball roll it into a small Puri Shape. Cut it into a round shape with a small size lid.</br></br>
            Place about 1tsp of stuffing in the middle.</br></br>
            Using little water line the edges of the Puri and cover the mixture by joining one side with the other.</br></br>
            Now take the Ghughra in your hand and lightly press edges between your fingers & make pleats to give Ghughra Design. You can also make designs on ghughra using a fork.</br></br>
            Repeat the process for the rest of Gujiyas.Heat Oil for Frying ghuhghra. Once the oil is hot reduce the flame to low and Fry 9-10 mini size ghughra at a time.</br></br>
            Fry till Ghughra till it becomes light golden color. One batch takes around 5-7 min for frying.</br></br>
            Once done take it out on a paper napkin.</br></br>
            Allow Ghughra to cool down completely and then put it in an air-tight container.</br></br>
